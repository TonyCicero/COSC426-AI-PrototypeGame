COSC 425/426 World Simulation game using Unity's AIPlanner

This project demonstrates the robust and complex features for creating agents to navigate their way around, learn from various environments, interact with other agents in order to make a living and exhibit various path algorithms for certain pathways to be executed by the agents. We used Unity, which is a powerful platform for creating or initiating tools and algorithms to create different environments and exciting games. A neat feature is that we made it as user-friendly as possible when a particular user is playing our game, the agent being able to navigate through different weather changes and the agent interacting with important elements for survival purposes such as water, food, weapons and attack modes. Not only did we have the mindset to make it a game, but also for the user to learn how essential Artificial Intelligence can be implemented to convey others how computing can be so powerful. This project solely concentrates on the aspect of artificial intelligence and algorithmic mechanisms throughout our simulating game. We used and implemented the C# programming language to create our simulation game.
